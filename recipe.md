INSTRUCTIONS
 
Put a non stick pan on a high heat.
Chop the block of tofu into small cubes.
Add the sliced tofu to the pan and cook for 4 minutes stirring regularly. When it starts to stick to the pan ‘deglaze’ the pan by adding a couple of tablespoons of water and incorporating the flavour. Steam should rise when you deglaze the pan which will help cook the tofu.
Drain and rinse the beans. Add them to a bowl along with the ground coriander and the juice of 1/2 lime. Slice the cherry tomatoes in two and add them to the beans and mix well.
Time to pimp out your bowls – presentation is important in this dish so take your time and do your best to make your bowls look pretty.
Divide out the pre-cooked quinoa between 2 wide bowls. Divide the bean mix between both bowls. Slice the radishes into thin circles and divide them between both bowls. Spoon out the avocado half onto a chopping board and slice into strips and divide between the 2 bowls.
Add the tamari, the nutritional yeast, sesame and pumpkin seeds to the cooking tofu. Stir to incorporate it all and cook for a further minute and then turn off.
Top each bowl with the tofu.
Garnish with some chopped herb of choice or micro greens.
Enjoy!
